    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Research, e.g. [Kraut et al](http://kraut.hciresearch.org/sites/kraut.hciresearch.org/files/open/kraut90-InformalCommInOrgs.pdf), indicates that informal organisational-networks play an important role in facilitating productive and efficient organisational processes. As these networks are not defined within a clear organisational hierarchy, however, developing an understanding of how staff interact informally is challenging to achieve. This tool seeks to clarify this uncertainty, through the utilization of interaction-based data, to identify the informal roles that staff appear to be occupying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on research by [Harris & Nelson](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Applied_Organizational_Communication.html?id=9s6OAgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y), this tool was designed to identify five key informal roles within staff networks: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Organizer - This role is concerned with individuals that link different groups across organisational-networks. Project-managers are a quintessential example of this role, as these individuals often traverse numerous organisational-communities in order to spread information and manage tasks across project-networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gatekeeper - Gatekeepers are the individuals that facilitate and mediate an effective flow of information across communication-networks. If a teams delivery-manager, for example, is the only individual within that team frequently interacting with a wider organisational network, this indivdual would act as the gatekeeper of information to their team.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stars - These individuals are at the heart of organisational communities, and often have significant influence with fellow community-members. Stars can potentially be team-managers, however these individuals may also not have a determined official role. Essentially a star is an individual with strong community-presence, whether that presence if formal or informal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Isolates - As the name suggests, these are individuals who do not need to communicate within a wider organisational-network to carry out their work. A contractor who only converses with a specific team-member, for example, can be regarded as an isolate. These individuals are important to identify, as they are likely last to be reached by information flowing through a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Members - Group-members are individuals that are non-identifiable in the context of the other roles listed, and individually do not have as much potential to impact network efficiency like other identified roles.\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enron email-corpus was used for constructing this tool, as to my knowledge this is the only open-source dataset containing comprehensive information relating to internal organisational communication. This dataset contains around 500,000 emails from Enron staff between 1998-2002, and was released as part of a fraud investigation of Enron after its liquidation in 2002. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tools functioning is based on a variety of metrics relevant to network-science, which can be used to evaluate the importance and characteristics of actors within constructed networks. Before development, an extensive period of time was dedicated to examining which particular metrics would be most informative in the context of this research. Research by [Schwartz and Jacobson](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0030507377900265), for example, helped contextualize the organisational importance of the roles mentioned above, while lectures from [DH Chau](http://poloclub.gatech.edu/cse6242/2014spring/lectures/CSE6242-20140218-GraphsAlgoApp.pdf) helped inform which network-based metrics would be most appropriate for role-identification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tool is Python-based, and utilizes packages which specialize in network-science. NetworkX, especially, provided a package which contained a multitude of different metrics and techniques utilized by this research. \n"

    "### Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is warranted, as it can assist in answering key questions regarding organizational dynamics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Who are the key players in the network, officially and informally?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which staff have more of an influence on internal-communication networks than others?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is information within the network spreading efficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, this tool seeks to provide decision-makers with a data-driven understanding of organisational dynamics, which can be used to build on their current understanding of how organisational interaction is taking place. Therefore, this tool should not be considered as a replacement of an organisational map, but as a point of reference to evaluate if current organisational process is effective."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Betweenness-centrality: A measure of how many of the shortest paths in a network flow through a particular node. If a node has high betweenness-centrality, it indicates that this node is very central in the network structure, and is therefore more likely to be an interaction hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Eigenvector Centrality: A measure of a nodes number of connections, which more weight given to nodes whose connections are to other important nodes. This metric is useful, as organizers are likely to interact extensivley with other hub-based nodes, such as senior-managers or delivery-managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* PageRank: This measure was created by Google, and is used to rank the importance of websites which appear in Google search results. Essentially, the algorithm uses a probability distribution to represent the likelihood that a given signal travelling through a network will end up at a particular node, with a nodes score determined as the probability of landing there if the signal was randomly stopped.

Primarily, the Louvain method returned the highest modularity score for all algorithms tests (0.543 for Louvain, 0.442 for nearest algorithm). Secondly, Louvain was also selected as it produced a good amount of communities relative to the small dataset(6), while other methods were producing up to 13."
